Replit build prompt (copy/paste)

You are building a mobile-first internal web app called “Station 44 Hub”. 
I am working from iOS only. Keep the setup simple, with minimal dependencies, and make it easy to extend.

## 0) Product Requirements (PRD)
Goal:
- A fast internal hub for operational links and templates.
- Convenience-first: no authentication for MVP.
- No sensitive / patient data.
- Users must find info within 5 seconds.
- Key interactions: Search → open link/template immediately.

Users:
- Internal staff who have the app link.

Core MVP Features:
1) Home dashboard with:
   - Collapsible notification/news bar (Important News) at top
   - Search bar under it (search by title, tags, category)
   - 4 category tiles/cards: Roster, Ambulance Duty, Training, Administrative
   - Each tile shows its links in a short list
   - Each tile has an “updates” badge (small numbered indicator in top-right) showing how many items were updated recently

2) Bottom navigation:
   - Home (active)
   - Protocols / SOP (greyed out / disabled as “Coming Soon”)
   - Tapping the disabled item should show a “Coming Soon” toast or small modal (not a navigation)

3) Updates system:
   - App should visually indicate “recently updated” items and total count
   - There must be a global updates indicator icon/badge in the top-right (like a bell badge) that shows total recent updates
   - “Recent” is defined as updated within last 14 days (make this a constant so I can change it)

4) Data management:
   - Use a single JSON data source in the repo for all items (links + templates + news)
   - Make it easy for me to edit on phone:
     - Editing one JSON file should update the app
   - Provide categories, tags, and lastUpdated fields for each item

5) Templates:
   - Cardiac Arrest Report Template should be accessible inside the app as a copyable template (not just plain text hidden in code).
   - Offrun Template should be accessible similarly (even if it just links to the offrun form, include a “template/instructions” entry too).
   - These templates should be searchable.

Non-goals for MVP:
- No login/auth, no role-based access, no PDF full-text search for now (only metadata search).
- No backend database for MVP.

## 1) Information Architecture (Categories + Items)
Build the 4 sections exactly like this:

A) Roster
1) Roster link

B) Ambulance Duty
1) Armoury list

5) IFleet check
   https://go.gov.sg/s44dailycameracheck

C) Training
1) CET-CME schedule (current year cumulative)
   (store as a “content item” inside the app, not a link)
   CET-CME 2026:
   January: 12th, 13th, 26th, 27th
   May: 4th, 5th, 8th
   October: 1st, 2nd, 8th
   January 2026 breakdown:
   1st div: 12th
   2nd div: 27th
   3rd div: 26th
   4th div: 13th
2) Post night training link (PNT)
   https://go.gov.sg/stn44pnt
3) Current month drills
   (create a placeholder “content item” that I can edit monthly in the JSON)

D) Administrative
1) Armoury onboarding link
   https://armoury.gov.sg/onboard?inviteCode=team-clmhguv3a0001%7C30808qzwx13
2) Cardiac Arrest Report Template (content item, searchable, copyable)
   Use the exact template text below:
   ---
   Cardiac Arrest Report
   Inc no: 2025xxxx/xxxx
   Callsign:
   PRM Name:
   Time of Call: xxxxHRS
   OHCA Type:
   E-Sub Status & Date: Not yet
   (To be completed in 3 days)
3) Offrun Template (content item + link)
   Link:
   https://form.gov.sg/66179e5bc4e9a0f205e9ec3e
   Content:
   “Use this form to submit offrun. Ensure fields are completed before end of shift.”
4) Morning briefing
   (create a placeholder link or content item; show it in Important News by default)

## 2) Search Requirements
- Single search bar on Home page
- Search across:
  - title
  - tags
  - category name
  - content (for content items like CET schedule, templates)
- Results should display:
  - title
  - category
  - a short snippet (for content items)
  - open action:
    - if link: open in new tab
    - if content: open an in-app detail view

## 3) Notification / Important News
- A top notification bar that can collapse/expand
- Default state: expanded showing 1–2 key messages
- Expanded state shows:
  - “Important News” label
  - list of news items (from JSON)
  - each news item has: title, date, optional link, and optional “new” label
- Collapsed state: a slim bar with “Important News” and a chevron icon
- Must not feel cluttered.

## 4) Updates Badges
- Each category card shows a small badge count = number of items with lastUpdated within last 14 days
- A top-right global updates icon (bell) shows total recent updates
- Recent update logic based on lastUpdated field in JSON

## 5) Design Guidelines (must follow exactly)
Colors:
- Primary: #0D0C22
- Accent: #FFFFFF
- Background: #FFFFFF
- Text Primary: #808080
- Link: #060318

Typography:
- Heading font: Mona Sans
- Body font: Arial (primary) with Helvetica Neue as alternative
- h1: 24px
- h2: 24px
- body: 16px

Spacing:
- Base unit: 4px (use multiples: 4/8/12/16/20/24)
- Border radius: 4px

Personality:
- Modern
- Medium energy
- Audience: design professionals
- Keep it clean and not cluttered.

Style reference:
- Use the attached photo as style inspiration:
  - soft, clean, “design professional” UI
  - subtle elevation/shadows, airy spacing, rounded containers
  - minimal iconography, restrained visual noise
  - light background with calm depth (avoid heavy gradients)
  - keep contrast accessible

Specific UI:
- Category cards: clean white surfaces with subtle shadow, thin dividers, icon on left, badge on top-right
- Bottom nav:
  - Home active (Primary color)
  - Protocols/SOP greyed out with “Coming soon” treatment

## 6) Deliverables / File Structure
Create the following structure:
- /public (icons if needed)
- /src
  - /data/appData.json   (single source of truth)
  - /components (Card, Badge, NewsBar, SearchBar, BottomNav)
  - /pages (Home, Detail)
  - /styles (theme tokens: colors, spacing, typography)
- Include clear comments/instructions in README:
  - “To update links/news/templates, edit src/data/appData.json”
  - “To change ‘recent update window’, edit RECENT_DAYS constant”

## 7) Acceptance Criteria
- Home loads fast and looks uncluttered on mobile width
- Search works across all items and returns correct category
- Clicking link items opens external URL
- Clicking content items opens in-app detail view with copy button
- News bar collapses/expands
- Badge counts work (category + global)
- Protocols/SOP is visible but disabled and shows Coming Soon on tap
- Visual design matches the provided tokens and clean design reference style

Now build the project in Replit with this structure, implement the UI, the JSON-driven data, and the required interactions.

What you do next (action, not theory)
	1.	Create a new Replit → choose React (or “Vite + React” if available).
	2.	Paste the prompt above into Replit AI.
	3.	After it generates, your only editing job becomes updating src/data/appData.json.

If Replit generates something off-brand (wrong colors/spacing), tell me and paste the generated theme or styles file here—I’ll rewrite it to match your tokens exactly.
