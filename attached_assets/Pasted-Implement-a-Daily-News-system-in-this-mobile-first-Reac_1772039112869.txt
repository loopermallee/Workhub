Implement a “Daily News” system in this mobile-first React webapp.

## Requirements Summary
- Important News card is collapsible/expandable.
- Users can view active announcements; expired announcements remain accessible but visually “outdated”.
- Admin posting is a secret feature: tap the Important News card 7 times within 4 seconds → PIN modal appears. Correct PIN unlocks Admin page.
- PIN is the same for everyone and stored in an environment variable (REPLIT_NEWS_ADMIN_PIN).
- News fields: title, body, expiresAt (date/time). createdAt is auto-generated.
- Past/expired news remains on a dedicated News page and appears muted with an “Expired” label.

## Tech constraints
- Must work fully in Replit.
- Use Replit Database (key-value) for persistence.
- No external services.
- Keep it simple, readable, and easy to extend.
- Mobile UX: clean, uncluttered, matches existing style tokens.

## Data model
Each news item:
- id: string (e.g. Date.now().toString())
- title: string
- body: string
- createdAt: ISO string
- expiresAt: ISO string

DB keys:
- news:index => JSON array of ids (newest first)
- news:<id> => JSON news item

## API Endpoints
Create minimal server endpoints:
1) GET /api/news
   - Returns { active: NewsItem[], expired: NewsItem[] }
   - Sort newest first by createdAt
   - active: now < expiresAt
   - expired: now >= expiresAt

2) POST /api/news
   - Header or body must include admin PIN for auth
   - Validate title not empty
   - Validate expiresAt is a valid future datetime (allow same-day future)
   - Save item, update index
   - Return created item

Optional:
3) DELETE /api/news/:id (admin only)
   - Not required unless easy

## Frontend UI
A) Important News card component
- Collapsible/expandable.
- Collapsed:
  - Show “Important News” header + chevron icon
  - Show latest 1–2 active items (title + date)
  - If no active items: show “No current updates”
- Expanded:
  - Show list of active items (scroll area with max height)
  - Provide “View all” link to /news
- Must have a subtle icon indicating it can be tapped to expand/collapse.

B) Secret Admin entry
- Track taps on Important News card:
  - If 7 taps within 4 seconds, open PIN modal.
- PIN modal:
  - Numeric input
  - Submit button
  - If PIN matches REPLIT_NEWS_ADMIN_PIN → route to /admin/news
  - If wrong → shake/error message + reset.
- Keep discreet: do NOT show “admin” hints unless triggered.

C) News page (/news)
- Show two sections:
  1) Current (Active)
  2) Past (Expired)
- Expired items:
  - Muted styling
  - “Expired” label
  - Still readable
- Add a simple “read” UI indicator:
  - Store read ids in localStorage (news:read)
  - If user taps an item, mark read; show a “Read” style (lighter)
  - This is per-device; no login.

D) Admin page (/admin/news)
- PIN is required (if user navigates directly, show PIN modal).
- Form fields:
  - Title (required)
  - Body (optional multiline)
  - Expiry datetime (required; use datetime-local input)
- Publish button:
  - Calls POST /api/news with PIN
  - On success: show toast “Published” and clear form
- Show list of existing news (active + expired) with timestamps for admin visibility.

## File organization
- src/components/ImportantNewsCard.jsx
- src/pages/NewsPage.jsx
- src/pages/AdminNewsPage.jsx
- server routes for /api/news (depends on current setup; implement in existing server structure)
- Use existing styling system; do not introduce clutter; keep UI modern, minimal.

## Acceptance
- I can post a news item in the admin page and it appears immediately in Important News card and /news page.
- Important News card expands/collapses smoothly.
- 7 taps triggers PIN prompt; normal users won’t notice.
- Expired news is still visible but clearly marked outdated.
- Works on iPhone viewport cleanly.

Implement this now in the project. Add instructions in README:
